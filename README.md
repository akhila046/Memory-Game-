1. When the game starts, all cards are placed face down.
2. The player clicks on a card to reveal it.
3. The player clicks on a second card to try to find a match.
4. If the cards match, they remain revealed. If not, they flip back.
5. The game continues until all pairs are matched.
6. The game records the **total moves** and **time taken**.
